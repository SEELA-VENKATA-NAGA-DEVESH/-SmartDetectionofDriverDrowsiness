# SmartDetectionofDriverDrowsiness

Our driver drowsiness detection system uses OpenCV and dlib to analyze real-time video and extract facial landmarks, focusing on the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to monitor eye closure. It accurately detects drowsiness, even for individuals wearing spectacles. Optimized for energy efficiency, it is ideal for continuous vehicle monitoring and performs reliably under various conditions. Utilizing non-invasive, cost-effective hardware and open-source software, our solution is robust and accessible, addressing limitations of existing methods and enhancing driver safety in real-time.
